= TODO =
- handle method arguments in function.cpp template.
	- We need to look through the metadata to know how many arguments, their types, map from JSValue arguments to appropriate types, etc and forward on to method call
	- handle overloads of same method with different argument counts/types. We have one bridge method that needs to handle every variation of overload.
- Fix escaping of complex types that use templates. See TITANIUM_PROPERTY_GETTER(UIElement, PointerCaptures) in Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.cpp
	- We need to use <%- tag to avoid escaping, but we aso appear to need to clean up the bad metadata which added "class " prefix to templated type inside the IVectorView.
- Better handle polymorphism on getters when unwrapping?
	- We know the defined return type from metadata, but that could be a parent/base type and the actual property value is a subclass. We effectively lose that info and have no means to cast down to subclass. May need some special syntax in JS to do the casting?
- Handle mapping primitives better
	- I might not be casting appropriately, and we may need to worry about signed/unsigned mismatches
	- I'm not handling all the primitive types, just some
- Events
	- I'm not exposing events/handlers at all - or maybe I am but haven't really hooked them up properly...
	- We'll likely want to allow users to register a function callback as a handler and do the magic work behind the scenes for them.
- Add #includes for all the types referenced in cpp files
	- Right now I just include the header for the type we're implementing. We need to gather all the types we reference and include the relevant wrapper headers
- Handle non-default constructors for wrapped types
- Handle constructions of structs
	- We don't look at metadata to see how many args they require in their constructor. We can probably cheat and just populate with 0/"" values and then explicitly assign property/fields
	- See Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Control.cpp TITANIUM_PROPERTY_SETTER(Control, Padding) for an example where we need to construct a Thickness struct
- handle some oddball metadata issues
	- See Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Control.cpp TITANIUM_PROPERTY_SETTER(Control, DefaultStyleKey) for example where we think "object" is a class and should likely just treat it as some base type like Titanium::Module/JSExport.
- Use JSExport as root, not Titanium::Module.
- Run against entire set of metadata, not my filtered down metadata.json file. (Use hyperloop_windows_metabase.json.gz)
